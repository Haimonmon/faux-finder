The appeal came during a Concelebrated Mass “for Guidance, Truth, and Accountability for aviation industry officials,” in Pasay City, which was officiated by Bishops Ben Labor, Aldrin Lleva, and Agustino Tangca.

In their homily and joint statement, the bishops emphasized that public welfare should instead take precedence over profit of private companies.

Bishop Ben Labor said in a press release that, “In this spirit of shared responsibility, Institutions such as the NAIA airport should serve the welfare of passengers and workers, including the small businesses, and not just the interests of a few powerful corporations.”

Bishops Lleva and Tangca, meanwhile, appealed to the Supreme Court, to “temporarily freeze all fees increases at the NAIA so that the concerned parties, may clarify first the proceeds of such increases on travel tax, parking fees, stall and office rentals, airline’s use of parking and runway, ticket charges, among others, and for transparency, and consequent accountability, prevail.”

Leaders of PUSO ng NAIA, who organized the event, emphasized that the campaign was not only about protecting travelers from higher costs but also about upholding transparency, accountability, and fairness in the operations of the country’s airport.

Based on the Manila International Airport Authority Revised Administrative Order No. 1 (series of 2024), the passenger service charge for international departing passengers increased from P550 to P950.

For domestic departing passengers, the terminal fee will go up from P200 to P390.

Airport workers, civic organizations, and non-government groups earlier asked the Supreme Court to declare the NAIA PPP project unconstitutional due to the increase of airport-related fees.

Through the PPP project, the management of the airport was transferred to the San Miguel-led  NNIC. — Anna Felicia Bajo/RF, GMA Integrated News"

In a 20-page complaint, Topacio said Remulla, Santiago, and John and Jane Does committed arbitrary detention and violation of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act over the “illegal arrest and unlawful detention” of Guo and Ong.

He argued that the arrests were made without the benefit of a warrant.

“The agents of the NBI were not armed with warrants of arrests, as required by law, and when there are no circumstances to justify a warrantless [arrest], such as when a crime is committed in flagrante delicto, or when an accused in is hot pursuit,” Topacio said.

Guo and Ong were about to depart Batam, Indonesia when they were intercepted by authorities during the height of the investigation into Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators.

They were shortly brought to the Philippines.

Topacio said that the two were only arrested by virtue of the contempt orders issued by the Senate and the House of Representatives.

“Ms. Ong was detained for four days at the said NBI office, and it was only after four days of detention with the NBI that Ms. Guo and Ms. Ong were transferred to the detention facilities of the HoR and Senate,” he said.

“I was informed that, despite the clear legal and procedural infirmities in both the arrests and detention of Ms. Guo and Ms. Ong, respondent Santiago only pushed through with the same because he was ordered to do so by respondent Remulla,” he added.

When asked why he only filed a case now, Topacio said this is ""a non-issue.""

""The case has not yet prescribed and the incident may be subject of a legitimate complaint,"" he said.

Ong, the authorized representative of the raided POGO hub in Porac, has been charged with disobedience to summons issued by the House of Representatives as well as obstruction of justice for harboring, concealing, or facilitating the escape of a criminal offender.

She and others were also charged with qualified human trafficking in April.

https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/topstories/nation/959216/magalong-ici-can-regularly-file-cases-on-flood-control-anomalies/story/,Magalong: ICI can regularly file cases on flood control anomalies,,By GMA Integrated News,"September 15, 2025 at 9:46 PM","The Independent Commission for Infrastructure (ICI) can already file cases against those involved in the anomalous flood control projects in the country, according to special adviser Baguio City Mayor Benjamin Magalong.

In Sandra Aguinaldo’s Monday report on “24 Oras,” Magalong explained that it is possible to file cases because some information has been revealed.

However, he added that more time is needed to investigate the deep and widespread alleged corruption involving billions for flood control.

“Kung kabuuan, yung corruption sa infrastructure talagang matagal na laban ito, pero regularly, periodically meron kaming maipa-file na kaso,” Magalong said.

(Overall, corruption is a long-term problem, but regularly, periodically, we will file a case.)

Earlier today, Magalong was present during the oath-taking of the ICI members.

The body's chairperson is former Supreme Court Associate Justice Andres Bernal Reyes Jr., and the members are former Public Works and Highways Secretary Rogelio “Babes” Singson and certified public accountant Rossana Fajardo.

Magalong said he will share the pieces of evidence related to the flood control projects with the ICI.

“May mahirap, may madali kasi marami namang magagandang impormasyon na naibibigay ang pribadong sektor at yung mga local government. Yung mga personalities behind it kailangan talaga yung matinding ebidensya din,” he said.

(Some are difficult while some are easy to acquire because the private sector and local government units are giving information. We need evidence to prove the involvement of certain personalities.)

Magalong added that the ICI will coordinate with law enforcement agencies in the investigation.

“Kailangan talaga ng imbestigador kasi may tradecraft yan, may skills, merong talent. Hindi basta basta kung sino-sino na lang ang puwedeng magtanong-tanong diyan,” he said.

(We need investigators because they have tradecraft, skills, and talent. We cannot choose a random person for the job.) —Mariel Celine Serquiña/LDF, GMA Integrated News"

“I believe those are ghost projects,” Belmont said in Maki Pulido’s “24 Oras” report.

At a press conference, the Quezon City local government revealed that 331 flood control projects are worth P17 billion, of which P7.7 billion are alleged insertions and were not included in the 2024 and 2025 National Expenditure Program.

“Ang binigay sa amin ay scope of work lamang o yung general information lang. Hindi isinumite hanggang ngayon ang tinatawag na program of works na mas detalyadong impormasyon ang nilalaman,” Belmonte said.

(They only gave us the scope of work or the general information. Until now, they have yet to submit the program of works, which has a more detailed content.)

Among these flood control projects is the rehabilitation of the drainage system in Barangay South Triangle, where the only visible change from February 2024 to September 2025 is the painted sidewalk.

The said project cost P70 million.

“It appears wala talagang ginawa sa ilalim, unless napakagaling ng contractor na ginayang gaya ang pag-restore,” said Marck Dale Perral, head of Quezon City Engineering Department.

(It appears they did nothing underneath, unless the contractor is amazing, that they did the exact thing during restoration.)

The Quezon City government observed that the P48 million drainage system rehabilitation in Barangay Tatalon also had a painted sidewalk and a manhole that was replaced.

Belmonte said if the P17 billion funds were used properly, it could have almost completed the P24 billion drainage masterplan of the city, or used to build more than 5,000 classrooms, 350 PhilHealth Accredited Health Centers, or over 1,500 houses for informal settler families.

In a Super Radyo dzBB report, Belmonte said the city government itself had to conduct a “fact-finding inspection” because the DPWH allegedly failed to provide details about the projects.

QC officials also raised concerns over irregularities such as:

Of the total, 91 projects were listed as completed but were found to be still ongoing during inspection, Belmonte added.

Independent probe sought

Belmonte said the city government will submit the results of its inspection to the newly created Independent Commission on Infrastructure (ICI) for further investigation.

She also welcomed President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s directive giving local government units (LGUs) the authority to sign off on completed infrastructure projects instead of the DPWH.

The Quezon City government is also drafting an ordinance to encourage residents to report questionable projects in their communities. Belmonte added that the probe is ongoing, and questions remain on which contractors were awarded the biggest projects and which districts received the most flood control allocations. — Mariel Celine Serquiña and Sherylin Untalan/RF, GMA Integrated News"
https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/topstories/world/959215/israel-threatens-hamas-wherever-they-are-as-qatar-hosts-summit/story/,Israel threatens Hamas ‘wherever they are’ as Qatar hosts summit,,"By ANDREW MILLS, JANA CHOUKEIR, SIMON LEWIS and STEVEN SCHEER, Reuters","September 15, 2025 at 9:58 PM","DOHA/JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he didn't rule out further strikes on Hamas leaders ""wherever they are"" as the heads of Arab and Islamic states held a summit to show support for Qatar after Israel's attack on the Gulf state last week.

The September 9 strike targeting leaders of the Palestinian militant group in Doha marked a significant escalation of Israeli military action in a region shaken by conflict since the Hamas-led October 7, 2023 attacks that ignited the Gaza war.

The emergency Arab-Islamic summit hosted by Doha is expected to warn that the Israeli attack and other ""hostile acts"" by Israel threaten coexistence and efforts to normalize ties in the region, according to a draft resolution seen by Reuters.

Addressing the summit, Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani said the Israeli attack was ""cowardly and treacherous,"" saying Hamas leaders had been studying a US ceasefire proposal presented to them by Qatar and Egypt when it took place.

Hamas says the Israeli attack killed five of its members but not its leadership. A member of Qatar's internal security forces was also killed.

Targeting close US ally Qatar, the Israeli strike has prompted US-allied Gulf Arab states to close ranks, notably adding to strains in ties between the United Arab Emirates and Israel, which were normalised in 2020.

Speaking alongside US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Jerusalem, Netanyahu said Israel was still getting final reports on the results of the strike.

Rubio will travel to Qatar after his visit to Israel, a senior US State Department official said.

Rubio called on Qatar to continue to play a constructive role in resolving the Gaza conflict, saying it could help reach the goals of releasing all 48 hostages still held in Gaza, disarming Hamas and building a better future for Gazans.

""And so we're going to continue to encourage Qatar to play a constructive role in that regard,"" he said.

US President Donald Trump has indicated displeasure at the attack and said on Sunday Israel should be careful.

""My message is that they have to be very, very careful. They have to do something about Hamas, but Qatar has been a great ally to the United States,” he said.

Israeli attack threatens 'coexistence'

An excerpt of the draft resolution seen by Reuters said ""the brutal Israeli attack on Qatar and the continuation of Israel's hostile acts including genocide, ethnic cleansing, starvation, siege, and colonizing activities and expansion policies threatens prospects of peace and coexistence in the region.""

These actions threaten ""everything that has been achieved on the path of normalizing ties with Israel including current agreements and future ones,"" according to the draft, which was drawn up by foreign ministers meeting ahead of the summit.

Israel has been widely accused of committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, including by the world's biggest group of genocide scholars, during its nearly two-year campaign in the Palestinian enclave that has killed more than 64,000 people, according to local authorities.

Israel rejects the accusation, citing its right to self-defense following the October 7 attack that killed 1,200 people and resulted in the capture of 251 hostages, according to Israeli figures.

Qatar has acted as a key mediator in the Gaza conflict and has accused Israel of sabotaging chances for peace and Netanyahu of practicing ""state terrorism.""

Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani said on Sunday that Israel's actions would not stop Doha's mediation efforts with Egypt and the United States.

Israel destroys 16-floor building in Gaza

While diplomacy was unfolding in Jerusalem and Doha, Israeli forces were continuing their assault on Gaza City, where they killed at least 16 Palestinians in strikes on two homes and on a tent housing a displaced family, local health authorities said.

The army also hit and destroyed a 16-floor building in the west of the city, believed to be the tallest in the Gaza Strip, about an hour after warning displaced families sheltering inside and nearby to leave. It said the building was being used to hide ""terrorist infrastructure.""

Rubio gave strong backing to Israel, which has grown increasingly isolated on the world stage because of widespread indignation at the enormous death toll in Gaza and the ongoing humanitarian and hunger crisis in the Palestinian enclave. — Reuters"

During the plenary session, Estrada called Hernandez a “habitual liar” as he continued to deny the allegation.

“I am open to any investigation. In fact... I am willing to sign any waiver to open my bank accounts. Let me put that on record,” Estrada said.

Villanueva, meanwhile, said in an interview that he was also willing to do the same.

“Definitely, ever since, I’m open,” Villanueva told reporters.

PANTI, GMA Integrated News","September 18, 2025 at 10:27 AM","The Senate blue ribbon committee on Thursday cited contractor Pacifico ""Curlee"" Discaya II in contempt for lying about the absence of his wife, Sarah, during the probe into the anomalous government flood control projects.

The Blue Ribbon committee approved the motion put forward by Senator Raffy Tulfo to cite Curlee Discaya in contempt after he told the committee that his wife and business partner, Sarah, skipped the probe due to a ""heart condition.""

Senate Pro Tempore Panfilo Lacson, committee chairman, then read the letter sent by Sarah to the panel that she cannot attend due to a pre-scheduled meeting with her employees.

""Niloloko mo kami. You lied!"" Senator Erwin Tulfo said.

Asked to explain his answer, Mr. Discaya said his wife also has diabetes and hypertension too.

""Marami po siyang maintenance na gamot na ginagamit,"" he said.

At this point, the Senate blue ribbon panel had enough and carried the motion to cite Mr. Discaya in contempt.—AOL, GMA Integrated News"

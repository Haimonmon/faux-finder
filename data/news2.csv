Ghost, substandard flood control projects to be declared crime scenes — Magalong",,By GMA Integrated News,"September 16, 2025 at 9:27 PM","The alleged ghost and substandard flood control projects found in La Union will be declared as “crime scenes” to prevent any intrusion, Baguio City Mayor Benjamin Magalong, special adviser to the  Independent Commission for Infrastructure (ICI), said Tuesday.

“We're going to declare this as a crime scene. Isesecure namin ito kung sakaling may mag intrude dito, kakasuhan natin (we will secure the area so that we file charges to those who intrude),” Magalong said in Sendee Salvacio’s report on “24 Oras.”

Magalong made the remark as he and Department of Public Works and Highways Secretary Vince Dizon inspected the flood control projects in the towns of Bauang and Tubao.

“Meron kaming nakikitang mga pattern ng either ghost or substandard talaga. Ang isang napakimportanteng nakikita namin halos lahat ng nabisita naming mga proyekto walang maipakitang plano sa atin. Eh yun ang basis eh di natin yan maa-assess ng mabuti kung wala tayong pinagbabasehan at ‘yun lagi ang plano,” Dizon said.

(We saw a pattern that the flood control projects are either ghost or substandard. We saw that almost all of them have no construction plans. We cannot assess the projects thoroughly if we don’t have a basis.)

One of the flood control projects they inspected is the dike and riprap in Barangay Calumbaya, Baung, which cost P180 million.

Dizon said the project was awarded to a company named Silver Wolves and was supposed to be completed in March 2025, but workers were still found constructing in the area.

They also discovered that the pipes were fake and seemingly glued to the soil and that some parts of the dike were already damaged, allegedly due to rainfall.

Magalong said the pipes should be two meters long, but the ones they found did not reach a foot.

“No doubt kailangan ng flood control project dito. So ngayon ang ginawa namin ni Mayor Benjie dito tinitingnan natin ‘yung quality gawa. we want to check kung, clearly hindi ito ghost project kasi may nakikita niyo naman may proyekto. Pero mukhang, base palang sa observation namin ni Mayor Benjie, mukhang napaka-substandard nito.” Dizon said.

(No doubt a flood control project is needed here. Currently, Magalong and I are looking into the quality of the construction. Clearly, it's not a ghost project, but based on our observations, it seems it’s substandard.)

There is no available construction plan for the said flood control project, the officials said.

Magalong and Dizon also visited the P50-million flood control project in Barangay Anduya, Tubao, which was said to be completed cheaply since it is only 500 meters wide.

Another ghost project was found in Barangay Rizal, Tubao, which was reported to Magalong’s office after his appointment in the ICI.

He said verification is ongoing with regard to the said project.

The flood control projects in the Ilocos Region has a total of 651, which has a total amount of P39.3 billion.

The region acquired the fourth highest budget for flood control projects in the country, and fifth with the most number of builds.

Magalong ordered the suspension of flood control projects they visited while the investigation is ongoing.

“Questionable nga yung technology na ginamit considering na nakita niyo naman sa ibang lugar consistent na talagang buhos. Pero dito parang stone masonry naman ang ginamit. Bakit hindi consistent 'yung technology na ginamit. Bakit iba-iba?” Magalong said.

(The technology they used is questionable, considering that projects in other places are consistent, but here it seems that they use stone masonry. Why are they not consistent with the technology they use?) — Mariel Celine Serquiña/RF, GMA Integrated News"

PANTI, GMA Integrated News","September 16, 2025 at 9:38 PM","The Department of Justice (DOJ) will look into the 15-year record of Pacifico ""Curlee"" Discaya and his wife, Sarah, as government contractors if they apply for state witness status, Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla told the House Committee on Appropriations on Tuesday.

At the hearing of the DOJ's proposed P40-billion for 2026, Sagip party-list Rep. Henry Marcoleta asked Remulla if the Discaya couple may be taken in as state witnesses in filing charges against scrupulous flood control project contractors and their cohorts.

“We have a process to follow. But we also have a lot of questions to complete their history. Kasi kung sila'y 15 taon nang nakakontrata at ikikwento nila'y tatlong taon lang, marahil kulang ‘yan,” Remulla said.

(They have been government contractors for 15 years. If they will just tell us about the last three years of that span, that is incomplete.)

“Kailangan malaman natin ang buong kasaysayan ng kanilang nakakontrata at kung ano ang kanilang dinaanang patakaran at sinasabi nilang obligasyon. Labinlimang taon dapat mapag-aralan natin, dahil itong problemang ito ang bumabagabag sa ating bansa ngayon,” he added.

(We need to know their entire history as government contractors, who they contracted with, the policies they encountered, and their supposed obligations, because this problem has been a burden to our country.)

Contracts, dates, names

Given the Discaya’s long history of government contracting, Remulla said they must provide documents such as contracts, dates of projects, names of engineers, and lawmakers who are dipping their hands in government contracts.

""'Yan ang kailangan natin malaman. We cannot just settle for three years. If we need to go back as far as 1998, so be it. Hindi po tayo matututo kung hindi po natin titignan ang buong kasaysayan o sistema na umiiral,” Remulla said.

(We need to know all those. We won’t learn anything if we don’t know the history and the prevailing system that allowed such practice.)

The Discaya couple said several House lawmakers and Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) officials took commissions out of the government's flood control projects, which they were supposedly forced to comply with to continue doing business.

Pasig City Mayor Vico Sotto, however, warned the public against believing the Discayas, saying that they are weaving lies to be treated as state witnesses, given that their figures are inconsistent with what they have said in their past interviews about being billionaires.

“Taliwas ito sa statement nila sa isang interview, kung saan sinabi nilang bilyonaryo sila at nasa 11 digits na daw ang pera nila. Meaning, at least P10 billion. How can you be a billionaire with a 2% to 3% profit?” Sotto said.

Sotto defeated Sarah Discaya in the 2025 local elections.

(This is contrary to their statement in an interview, in which they said they were billionaires with cash that ran up to 11 digits. This means at least P10 billion. How can you be a billionaire with 2% to 3% profit?)

""Bakit 26 lang yung nasa listahan? Ang tanong, paano nila napili kung sino ‘yung nasa listahan na yun? Obviously, there is a lie somewhere. Itong listahan ni Discaya... itong buong statement nila, malinaw na malinaw na kasinungalingan,"" Sotto said.

(Who will dare do such a crime for a measly profit? Let us not fall for their attempt to get our sympathy.If they were telling the truth, why only list 26? How did they choose 26? Their entire statement, very clearly, is all lies.) –NB, GMA Integrated News"

“I do not believe that I am unwell. I've not been diagnosed with any serious mental conditions that would lead me to be unable to be fit for service. I still deeply respect him, though I think he is wrong in saying that,” Barzaga said in Jonathan Andal’s Tuesday report on “24 Oras.”

“That would set a bad precedent if I [release my] medical records [since they] are purely confidential. If there's a court order for me to submit medical records once I am questioned of my sanity and my ability to properly serve the people of my district, then i will submit medical record,” he added.

“Kumbaga (So to speak), he is not well. And I think everybody is seeing that,” Puno said earlier, as he questioned Barzaga's condition based on his current and past actions.

Barzaga also said he is ready should the House ethics committee remove him from his post, as the National Unity Party is looking to file a case against him for alleged misbehavior.

This includes his alleged inappropriate posts, disrespect to some government officials, and a post seemingly prompting setting the House of Representatives on fire.

“Under the House Ethics Committee rules, I don't think I could be held liable for postings that I made before I became a member of the House of Representatives. I am willing to lose my position as House of Representative if the ethics committee deems it necessary and just,” Barzaga said.

He also confirmed that he went to the office of House Majority Leader Sandro Marcos and asked for the latter's support to be made Speaker of the House of Representatives, but denied that he collected signatures and offered the deputy speakership position to those who would support him. — Mariel Celine Serquiña/RF, GMA Integrated News"

Kin of missing sabungero offered P1.5M bribe to withdraw charges",,By GMA Integrated News,"September 16, 2025 at 10:54 PM","Authorities arrested a married couple for attempting to bribe a family member of one of the missing sabungeros to withdraw the complaint filed before the Department of Justice (DOJ).

According to Emil Sumangil’s Tuesday report on “24 Oras,” the Philippine National Police – Criminal Investigation and Detection Group nabbed the couple in Rizal during an entrapment operation.

They allegedly tried to bribe Jaja Pilarta, the partner of John Claude Inonog, one of the missing sabungeros who disappeared in 2022.

In a complaint sheet acquired by GMA Integrated News, Pilarta said she was asked to keep quiet, cease from participating in any court hearings related to the missing sabungeros, and retract the complaint she filed against businessman Charlie ""Atong"" Ang and others.

“Ang gusto po nila, papel ng recantation po 'yon e na finile ko po sa DOJ laban po kina sir Atong Ang. Ang gusto po nila pirmahan ko 'yun tapos manahimik na ako kapalit ng P1.5 million,” Pilarta said.

(They want me to retract the recantation I filed before the DOJ against Atong Ang. They want me to keep quiet in exchange for P1.5 million.)

Based on the information acquired by the GMA Integrated News, the suspects face grave coercion and obstruction of justice charges.

According to a source, they were also relatives of Inonog.

“Ayoko ng areglo since Day 1. Napag-usapan na rin po 'yan noon. Masama 'yung loob ko, siyempre. Ano'ng gusto ba nilang gawin? Gayahin ko 'yung ginawa nila? Kawawa naman 'yung kapatid nila, kawawa naman 'yung anak niya 'di na nga nila mabigyan ng hustisya e. Ako na lang 'yung lumaban,” Pilarta said.

(I never wanted to settlement since Day 1. I already told them that. Of course I’m hurt. What do they want me to do? Do the same thing they did? I sympathize with their brother, who could not get justice. I’m the only one left to fight.)

CCTV footage submitted before the court showed that the couple repeatedly visited Pilarta at her home in their attempts to bribe her.

During the DOJ budget hearing at the House of Representatives, Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla said these cases make the investigation more challenging.

“Araw araw may nakukuha tayong human remains sa Taal. Ang DNA lang hindi pa namin napapausad kasi maraming pamilya pa ng missing sabungeros hindi pa nakukunan ng DNA at marami dyan ay nagpabayad na at nawawala na sila,” Remulla said.

(Everyday we retrieve human remains from Taal Lake. However, we cannot move forward with the DNA tests since some family members of the missing sabungeros have yet to take the test, ask for financial compensation, or have disappeared.)

CASUCIAN, GMA Integrated News","September 16, 2025 at 10:31 PM","The Metro Manila Council on Tuesday passed a resolution mandating national agencies to coordinate with local government units (LGUs) before planning any project in Metro Manila.

During the joint MMC and Regional Development Council meeting with the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) and the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG), the MMC backed President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr.’s decision to reinstate coordination between local and national governments on infrastructure and other projects.

This move came amid various investigations into “ghost projects” led by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) nationwide.

“Hindi lamang ito limited sa flood control projects ngunit anupang klaseng infrastructure projects at hindi lamang limited to DPWH, lahat ng national agencies. Kung anumang mga infrastructure projects ang gusto nilang ipatupad sa aming mga lungsod, dapat po sila ay makipagugnayan sa amin at mayroon kaming approval sa mga proyektong ito,” said MMC president and San Juan Mayor Francis Zamora.

(This is not just limited to flood control projects, but to any other kind of infrastructure projects and not just limited to the DPWH, but to all national agencies. Whatever infrastructure projects they wish to implement in our cities, they must coordinate with us and we must approve these projects first.)

“Sana sa planning stage palang, makonsulta na kami para hindi nasasayang ang mga projects ng national [government] dahil ito talaga ang kailangan namin sa local [level]… Mag-coordinate sana ang national at local [governments] para mas maging tama po ang magiging proyekto sa pangangailangan ng mamamayan natin sa ating mga cities,” added Pasay City Mayor Imelda Calixto-Rubiano.

(Hopefully, they would be able to consult us at the planning stage so that the national [government] projects will not go to waste, because this is what we really need in the local [level]… I hope the national and local [government] will coordinate so that the projects would be a better fit for the needs of our citizens in our cities.)

Zamora added that with the new resolution, mayors would now have accountability over projects being implemented within their cities.

MMC also suggested for DPWH to synchronize their flood control projects with the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) to avoid duplicate or unnecessary projects.

They also noted the need for permits before implementing any project.

“Of course, we will not accept any project na alam nating substandard, and we will not accept any project na alam nating non-existent o tinatawag nating ghost project, (that we know is non-existent or what we call a ghost project)” Zamora said.

Policy gaps

As MMC president, Zamora said that his fellow mayors have reported a lack of coordination between local and national governments.

Malabon Mayor Jeannie Sandoval said that her city often experienced sudden projects that messed up local traffic.

“Ever since, walang coordination ang local at tiyaka national [government]. Minsan nagkakavertical at tiyaka horizontal projects. Nagkakalintik-lintik yung traffic dahil walang traffic plan, bigla nalang gagawin [at] susulpot,” she shared.

(Ever since, there has been no coordination between the local and the national [government]. Sometimes, there are vertical and horizontal projects. The traffic gets messed up because there’s no traffic plan, they just come in [and] do it.)

Muntinlupa Mayor Ruffy Biazon also said that there was a policy gap in the coordination, which made a leeway for such issues.

“From my experience, there’s never been a policy compelling or requiring the coordination at wala rin namang policy na wag magcoordinate… It’s a policy gap. It’s been happening ng mahabang panahon, and in certain areas nagpro-proliferate yung mga ganun dahil di magkakasundo yung mga public officials,” he said.

(From my experience, there’s never been a policy compelling or requiring the coordination and there’s also no policy that says not to coordinate… It’s a policy gap. It’s been happening for the longest time, and in certain areas it proliferates because the public officials do’t agree with each other.)

Zammora said that the new ordinance that would require LGUs to accept and sort through projects before implementation will ensure that corruption will not occur.

“Yung requirement na mayroong acceptance ng LGUs, malaking bagay yan kasi we will now become part of accountability,” he said.

(The requirement for LGUS to accept, it’s already a big deal because we we will now become part of accountability.)

Earlier, Marcos announced that he will be reinstating the “acceptance” process of local government units before national government projects can be noted as completed.

He noted that it was “one of the best safeguards” the government had regarding government projects. — BM, GMA Integrated News"

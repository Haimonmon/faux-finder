Trump and his wife Melania arrived at Windsor Castle, the oldest and largest inhabited castle in the world and family home to British monarchs for almost 1,000 years. He was met by the monarch, his wife Queen Camilla, heir Prince William and his wife Kate before a carriage procession through the grounds.

Ahead of a lavish banquet there will be a military flypast, part of what Britain has said would be the largest military ceremonial welcome for a state visit in living memory.

Trump, an overt royal fan, has made little secret of his delight at being not just the first US leader, but the first elected politician to be invited by a British monarch for two state visits.

On his arrival, he told reporters he loved Britain. ""It's a very special place,"" he said.

UK hopes visit will cement 'special relationship'

Prime Minister Keir Starmer is hoping to use that sentiment to Britain's advantage as his government seeks to cement the two nations' ""special relationship,"" deepen economic ties, secure billions of dollars of investment, discuss tariffs and press the US president on Ukraine and Israel.

Companies including Microsoft, Nvidia, Google and OpenAI have already pledged £31 billion ($42 billion) in British investments over the next few years, in AI, quantum computing and civil nuclear energy.

Starmer also wants further progress on trade, after Britain secured the first deal with Trump to lower some tariffs. Talks may touch on remaining levies on steel, whisky and salmon.

""They want to see if they can refine the trade deal a little bit,"" Trump said when he left the White House for Britain on Tuesday.

But while Starmer is banking on the unrivalled royal allure helping cajole the anglophile president, whose mother came from Scotland, many pitfalls for Britain's prime minister remain.

Polls show Trump is widely unpopular in Britain and Starmer, faced with plummeting poll ratings of his own and economic woes, will need to show that his royal trump card can reap benefits.

Protesters pull off Epstein stunt despite high security

Awkward questions about late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein could also come to the fore.

Starmer, last week, sacked Peter Mandelson as Britain's ambassador in Washington over his ties to Epstein, which could lead to questions for both Starmer and Trump, whose own relationship with the financier has also come under scrutiny.

While there was a massive police operation in place in Windsor, police said four people had been arrested on Tuesday after images of Trump alongside Epstein were projected onto one of the castle's towers. Trump was not there at the time.

Large protests are also expected in London on Wednesday with 1,600 officers deployed to deal with a demonstration by the ""Stop the Trump Coalition.""

Commuters in the capital had mixed views about the visit, with some angry about the invitation and others saying it was smart politics and a good use of Britain's soft power.

""We're looking to sort of make the best of a bad situation,"" said lawyer Kirstie Robertshaw, 54.

Trump to be dazzled by pageantry

Wednesday will be dominated by ceremony. Trump and his wife Melania were first greeted by the king's ""very handsome"" elder son Prince William—as the president has called him—and Kate.

Charles and his wife Queen Camilla then joined the Trumps on the carriage procession, with the route lined by 1,300 British service personnel.

The president, occasionally chatting and smiling with the king, then inspected a guard of soldiers wearing scarlet uniforms and bearskin hats.

Later, the royals will show the president and first lady historical items from the Royal Collection relating to the US, before the Trumps visit St George's Chapel, the final resting place of Queen Elizabeth, who hosted Trump for his first state visit in 2019, where he will lay a wreath on her tomb.

There will be a flypast including UK and US F-35 military jets, a symbol of US-British defense collaboration, before an opulent state banquet where the king and president will make speeches.

For Charles himself, the visit might provoke mixed emotions. He has little obviously in common with Trump, from his 50 years championing environmental causes to his efforts to bring harmony between religions and his recent steadfast support for Canada, where he is head of state.

But the occasion will also afford him the greatest global attention since his coronation.

""If it goes well ... I think this will go down as the most consequential event in his reign,"" said historian Anthony Seldon.

On Thursday, the action will move to Starmer's Chequers country residence, where the focus will be on geopolitics. — Reuters"

According to Mark Salazar’s Wednesday report on “24 Oras,” the construction of the said flood control project has been allegedly slow.

“‘Pag naglagay ka kasi ng utal-utal, masusundan siya after three years, four years. Nandyan na ‘yung bagyo. ‘Yung dating maikli na nilagay mong riprap, tatamaan nanaman ng bagyo at iikutan ng tubig. Giba nanaman,” San Jose Mayor Jerold Peña told GMA Integrated News.

(When you build portion by portion, the next progress might come in three to four years. By then, the storms have already come, and the small amount of riprap that were initially installed will have been damaged by the water, causing them to collapse again.)

He added that when tropical cyclone Kristine hit their area, a large part of the unfinished riprap collapsed.

According to Peña, the foundation of the Bugay Bridge is also affected by the damaged riprap.

“Yung ilalim ng foundation ng bridge, ‘yung poste medyo nakakalkal ng tubig kasi ‘dun umiikot ang tubig. ‘Dun nagsisimula ‘yun. ‘Pag nasira yun, mas problema sa amin. Isa sa secondary arterial road yung Pugay section. ‘Pag na-paralyze kami, apektado ‘yung transport ng buong distrito namin papuntang Naga kasi isa ‘yun sa economic highway namin,” Peña said.

(The soil beneath the bridge’s foundation is gradually being eroded by the water current that now passes there. That's where the problem starts. Once it becomes damaged, it becomes a bigger issue for us. The Pugay section is part of a secondary arterial road. If we become paralyzed, the entire district’s transport to Naga is affected, because that’s one of our key economic highways.)

GMA Integrated News reached out to the Department of Public Works and Highways District Office (DPWH) district office but was referred to the agency’s regional officer.

However, DPWH Region 5 Office did not answer any calls.

Based on the onsite project board, the flood control project’s contractor is the Alro Construction and Development Corporation, with a cost of P121.68 million.

The Philippine Contractors Accreditation Board data showed that the father of 1-Rider party-list Representative Rodge Gutierrez is the authorized managing officer of Alro Construction.

Quimbo noted that the DPWH’s budget suddenly bloated from P825 billion to P1.113 trillion right after the bicam approved the General Appropriations Bill for this year.

“Matapos pong pumunta sa Senado at pumunta sa bicam, tama po ba, pag-alis sa amin sa House of [Representatives] P825 billion, pero nung inapprove after ng Senate at bicam, ang naging budget ay P1.113 trillion. Correct? Yes or no? Tumaas ang budget ninyo ng almost P289 billion. Tama? Nangyari ‘yan sa bicam? Tama?” the lawmaker asked the DPWH’s officials during the House Committee on Appropriations’ hearing on the agency’s proposed budget for 2026.

(After it went to the Senate and went to the bicam, when it left the House of Representatives, it was P825 billion. But when it was approved after the Senate and the bicam, the budget became P1.113 trillion. Correct? Yes or no? Your budget increased by almost P289 billion. Is that right? Did that happen in the bicam? Is that right?)

In response, DPWH Undersecretary Alex Bote said: “That’s on record.”

“That’s on the record, ang malinaw dito, ang insertions o ang paglobo o pagsingit nangyari sa bicam, hindi sa small committee dito sa House,” said Quimbo.

(That’s on the record, what's clear here is that the insertions, or the bloating or the squeezing in, happened in the bicam, not in the small committee here in the House of Representatives.)

Further, the Marikina lawmaker asked the DPWH if it is open to the idea of publicizing all the amendments to the department’s proposed budget for next year.

“Pwede bang lahat ng pagbabago diyan i-identify at isapubliko, okay ba kayo doon?” Quimbo asked DPWH Secretary Vince Dizon.

(Can all the changes there be identified and made public? Are you okay with that?)

Dizon replied, “Tingin ko magandang idea po ‘yun.”

(I think that's a good idea.)

Quimbo also encouraged the DPWH not to be afraid of identifying anyone who is pushing for amendments to their budget for the sake of transparency.

“Dapat isapubliko ‘yan. Kasi masyado nang maraming tinatamaan na hindi dapat tinatamaan,” he said.

(That should be made public. Because too many people who shouldn’t be affected are being affected.)

“In fairness, we need to isolate where the leaks are and who is responsible. Wag po kayong matakot, magagaling kayo diyan, masisipag kayo. Mas ikabubuti ng DPWH na kapag may nagtutulak ng pagbabago, may gustong magpalaki, gustong magdagdag, ilagay niyo ang pangalan, at para sila makipaglaban at ipagtanggol nila ang insertion na ‘yun,” he added.

(In fairness, we need to isolate where the leaks are and who is responsible. Don't be afraid, you're good at what you do, you're hardworking. It would be better for the DPWH that when someone pushes for a change, wants to increase or add something, you put their name on it so they can fight and defend that insertion.)

For her part, House Appropriations panel chairperson Rep. Mikaela Suansing said that the “small committee” deliberating on institutional amendments was already replaced by a budget amendments review sub-committee.

“Inabolish na natin yung small committee na nagde-deliberate ng institutional amendments. Ngayon po mayroon na tayong budget amendments review sub-committee. Lahat po ‘yun transparent na, lahat makikita na po ang mga dinideliberate na mga amendments at lahat po ng babaguhin,” she said.

(We have now abolished the small committee that was deliberating on institutional amendments. Now we have a budget amendments review sub-committee. All of that is now transparent; everyone will be able to see the amendments being deliberated and all the changes that will be made.)

DPWH’s original proposed budget for 2026 was over P881 billion, but it was reduced to over P625 billion after a review, removing around P255 billion.

Dizon earlier said that he scrapped all locally funded flood control projects and addressed the issues raised in the initial version of the budget, such as the funding of completed and duplicate projects."
https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/topstories/nation/959500/coa-flood-control-projects/story/,COA to file more raps over anomalous flood control projects,,"By MARIEL CELINE SERQUIÑA, GMA Integrated News","September 17, 2025 at 10:50 PM","The Commission on Audit (COA) will file more complaints on Thursday against private companies and individuals allegedly involved in the anomalous flood control projects in Bulacan.

COA earlier submitted fraud audit reports to the Office of the Ombudsman showing five control projects in Bulacan that were non-existent or substandard.

The commission will use the fraud audit reports as a basis for filing criminal complaints against contractors and former Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) officials under the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, the Government Procurement Act, and for falsification of public documents.

Last week, the Department of Public Works and Highways filed a graft complaint against 25 individuals and four contractors over the anomalous flood control projects.

The commission began its fraud audit, initially focusing on Bulacan projects, on August 12.

COA earlier found that P341 million worth of flood control projects by three contractors were either substandard, overpriced, or non-existent.

These companies are Wawao Builders, St. Timothy Construction Corporation, and SYMS Construction Trading. –NB, GMA Integrated News"

""Seriously concerned by reports of dangerous actions by China’s Coast Guard towards Philippines’ vessels at Scarborough Shoal, resulting in injury and damage. We call for restraint and respect for international law. Disputes must be settled peacefully,"" Australian Ambassador Marc Innes-Brown said on X.

The EU said ""international law and the 2016 arbitral award must be respected.""

A formal diplomatic protest will be filed against China on Thursday, the Department of Foreign Affairs said.

The US, Manila's long-time treaty ally, earlier condemned China's latest aggressive actions against the Philippines.

China claimed more than 10 Philippine vessels intruded into the shoal it calls Huangyan Island and used water cannons against it to drive them away.

The Philippine coast guard said two Chinese coast guard ships blasted a Bureau of Fisheries vessel, the BRP Datu Gumbay Piang, with powerful water cannons, “resulting in significant damage"" and caused injuries to crewmen.

The incident occurred nearly a week after China announced a plan to turn Scarborough Shoal as a national nature reserve - a move strongly protested by the Philippines.

The shoal, a U-shaped rocky outcrop teeming with marine resources, was seized by China from Manila in 2012 following a two-month standoff, triggering an arbitration complaint by the Philippines a decade ago.

Manila maintains it has sovereignty over the shoal, saying ""it forms an integral part of the Philippine national territory."" —LDF, GMA Integrated News"

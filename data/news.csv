The seven-page declaration is the result of an international conference at the UN in July - hosted by Saudi Arabia and France - on the decades-long conflict. The United States and Israel boycotted the event.

A resolution endorsing the declaration received 142 votes in favor and 10 against, while 12 countries abstained.

The vote comes ahead of a meeting of world leaders on September 22 - on the sidelines of the high-level UN General Assembly - where Britain, France, Canada, Australia and Belgium are expected to formally recognize a Palestinian state.

The declaration endorsed by the 193-member General Assembly condemns the attacks against Israel by Palestinian militants Hamas on October 7, 2023, which triggered the war in Gaza.

It also condemns the attacks by Israel against civilians and civilian infrastructure in Gaza, siege and starvation, ""which have resulted in a devastating humanitarian catastrophe and protection crisis.""

French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said the resolution secured the international isolation of Hamas.

""For the first time today, the United Nations adopted a text condemning it for its crimes and calling for its surrender and disarmament,"" he said in an X post.

The resolution was supported by all Gulf Arab states. Israel and the United States voted against it, along with Argentina, Hungary, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay and Tonga.

The declaration endorsed by the resolution says the war in Gaza ""must end now"" and support the deployment of a temporary international stabilization mission mandated by the UN Security Council.

The United States described the vote as ""yet another misguided and ill-timed publicity stunt"" that undermined serious diplomatic efforts to end the conflict.

""Make no mistake, this resolution is a gift to Hamas,"" US diplomat Morgan Ortagus told the General Assembly. ""Far from promoting peace, the conference has already prolonged the war, emboldened Hamas and harmed the prospects of peace in both short and long term.""

Israel, which has long criticized the UN for not condemning Hamas by name for the October 7 attacks, dismissed the declaration as one-sided and described the vote as theater.

""The only beneficiary is Hamas …When terrorists are the ones cheering, you are not advancing peace; you are advancing terror,"" Israel's UN Ambassador Danny Danon said.

The October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and about 251 were taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies. More than 64,000 people, also mostly civilians, have since been killed during the war in Gaza, according to local health authorities. — Reuters"

Leviste,,"By LLANESCA T. PANTI, GMA Integrated News","September 12, 2025 at 10:54 PM","Part of the Department of Public Works and Highways’ (DPWH) proposed P880 billion budget for 2026 should be realigned to fund the Tulong Dunong program, a subsidy program for education-related expenses of students enrolled in private colleges and universities, Batangas Representative Leandro Leviste said.

Leviste made the suggestion during the recent budget hearing on Commission on Higher Education (CHED)’s proposed P33 billion budget for 2026, saying he will forgo budget items for roads in the first district of Batangas under the proposed DPWH budget in 2026, provided that it will be realigned to the Tulong Dunong Program.

“If my own district would need around 300 million pesos to give every potential student a slot under the Tulong Dunong Program, and our district would have let’s say around P2 billion pesos of roads under the proposed DPWH budget for 2026, then perhaps we could fund extra slots for Tulong Dunong to every college student who is qualified to receive it in the 1st District of Batangas by reducing the unit cost of the roads of DPWH by 15%, without reducing the kilometers of roads that are being constructed in my district in 2026,” he said.

Earlier, President Ferdinand ''Bongbong'' Marcos Jr. said that there would be no budget for flood control projects in 2026 budget of the DPWH.

Marcos had said that there were still funds for flood control projects in 2025, which had not yet been utilized.

The pronouncement also came on the heels of anomalies in the use of flood control funds since 2022.

Beneficiaries of the Tulong Dunong program receive P7,500 per semester or P15,000 per academic year. They should also be coming from a family with less than P400,000 combined household gross income, and should not be overstaying in the program.

“By merely reducing the cost per kilometer by 15%, we can give every college student in my district a slot under the Tulong Dunong Program, provided they are qualified. So I would just like to ask if we can kindly make an amendment, at least in the 1st District of Batangas, if we can kindly reduce the unit costs of roads of the DPWH,” Leviste pointed out.

“This is a very good program, but at the moment, because of budgetary constraints, pinipili lang po natin ang mga beneficiaries sa program na ito. Mas marami din pong makikinabang kung automatic na lang po na lahat ng mga qualified na mga estudyante ay mabibigyan ng Tulong Dunong, budget permitting po, would you agree Madame Chair?” he added, addressing CHED Chairperson Shirley Agrupis.

Agrupis replied, “Kung may budget po, sino pang mag-hi-hindi na hindi matulungan ang mga nangangailangan na estudyante?.”

Leviste earlier filed House Bill 27 seeking a P1,000 monthly allowance for all students to cover each student’s expenses on food, transportation, and school supplies. —LDF, GMA Integrated News"

""We got him,"" Cox told reporters at a briefing.

The suspect, identified as Tyler Robinson, had confessed to a family friend – or ""implied that he had committed"" the murder to that friend – and that person in turn contacted the Washington County sheriff's office on Thursday.

A family member interviewed by investigators said Robinson had become more political recently and spoke in a disparaging manner about Kirk, Cox said. Robinson was taken into custody on Thursday night, about 33 hours after Kirk's murder, FBI Director Kash Patel said at the press conference.

Kirk, a close ally of US President Donald Trump, was killed by a single bullet as he spoke onstage at an outdoor amphitheater at Utah Valley University on Wednesday. Trump called the shooting a ""heinous assassination.""

Kirk's killing has stirred outrage among Kirk's supporters and denunciations of political violence from Democrats, Republicans and foreign governments.

""It is an attack on all of us,"" Utah's governor said at the press conference, drawing parallels between Kirk's murder and the assassinations of President John Kennedy, his brother Attorney General Robert Kennedy and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr in the 1960s.

""It is an attack on the American experiment,"" the governor said. ""It is an attack on our ideals.""

The shooting has punctuated the most sustained period of US political violence since the 1970s. Reuters has documented more than 300 cases of politically motivated violent acts across the ideological spectrum since supporters of Trump attacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021.

Tracking down the suspect

Previously, US investigators said they had found the bolt-action rifle believed to have been used to kill Kirk - a charismatic 31-year-old credited with building support for Trump in the 2024 presidential election. They released a series of security camera images of a person of interest and asked the public to help identify him.

Investigators spoke to Robinson's roommate, who showed them comments Robinson had made on Discord, a chat and streaming platform popular with gamers, discussing retrieving a rifle from a drop point and then dropping it in a bush wrapped in a towel. That matched the description of the gun recovered after the shooting in a wooded area near campus.

Ammunition found at the scene had been inscribed, Cox said. The messages on the casings included: ""Oh, Bella Ciao, Bella Ciao, Bella Ciao, Ciao""; ""If you read this, you are gay, LMAO""; and ""Hey fascist, catch!"" Cox told reporters.

Politicians, commentators and amateur sleuths have filled social media and online forums with speculation and blame-casting about the killer's identity and ideology. Cox told reporters he would leave interpretation of the messages on the ammunition to others for now.

Kirk, a well-connected activist, author and podcast host, was friends with Vice President JD Vance, Trump's family and others at the highest echelons of the US government.

Patel, the FBI director, also offered a personal tribute at the news conference: ""Rest now brother, we have the watch. I'll see you in Valhalla,"" he said in closing his remarks, referring to the heavenly reward for warriors in Norse mythology.

Kirk, co-founder and president of the conservative student group Turning Point USA, appeared at Utah Valley on Wednesday as part of a planned 15-event ""American Comeback Tour"" of US college campuses.— Reuters"
https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/topstories/metro/958988/student-beep-card-launch-postponed/story/,Student beep card launch postponed,,By GMA Integrated News,"September 13, 2025 at 12:13 AM","The Department of Transportation (DOTr) has postponed the launching of the student beep cards on September 15.

“Kailangan lang po naming mag-recalibrate ng system based sa aming initial assessment, para masigurong walang magiging problema sa pag-aapply ng mga estudyante para sa kanilang white beep cards,” the department said in a statement on Friday.

(We just need to recalibrate the system based on our initial assessment to ensure there will be no problems with students applying for their white beep cards.)

“We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience, and we assure everyone that we are working hard to resolve these system issues within the month.”

The student beep card will give commuting students a 50% discount on their rides on Metro Manila’s rail lines and can be renewed every school year.

Students must only present a valid student ID or registration form to avail of the card.

""In the meantime, the 50% train fare discount for students will continue using single journey tickets. Senior citizens and PWDs, meanwhile, may continue to use their existing white beep cards to avail of the 50% discount,"" the DOTr said. —Vince Angelo Ferreras/VBL, GMA Integrated News"
https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/topstories/nation/958985/icc-prosecutor-rejects-duterte-s-renewed-request-for-interim-release/story/,ICC prosecutor opposes Duterte's renewed request for interim release,,By GMA Integrated News,"September 13, 2025 at 12:04 AM","The Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) has opposed the ""renewed request for interim release"" of former President Rodrigo Duterte from detention in The Hague.

In its submission to the Pre Trial Chamber 1 dated August 28 and released on September 12, Deputy Prosecutor Mame Mandiaye Niang asked the court to ""reject"" the defense's request, saying, ""The continued detention of Mr Duterte remains necessary.""

""The Prosecution refers the Chamber to its previous submissions in its Response to the Defence’s Initial Request for Interim Release regarding why Mr Duterte’s continued detention is necessary to ensure his appearance at trial, to ensure that he does not obstruct or endanger the investigation or court proceedings, and to prevent him from continuing with the commission of crimes or related crimes which are within the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court and which arise out of the same circumstances,"" the prosecutor said.

According to the redacted document, there have been several events that ""exemplify"" why Duterte’s continued detention remains necessary, citing for one, ""continued attempts by Mr Duterte’s family to delegitimise the proceedings before this Court.""

""For example, on 19 July 2025, Sara Duterte, the current Vice President of the Philippines, spoke in front of a crowd in The Hague and was interviewed afterwards. During this event, she repeated the claim that Mr Duterte was 'kidnapped' by the ICC and stated that it was 'illegal' to bring him to the Court. She also told supporters, supposedly in jest, that she had discussed breaking Mr Duterte out of the ICC Detention Unit with a colleague,"" the prosecutor said.

""Also on 19 July 2025, while making a speech on the front steps of the ICC, Sara Duterte falsely claimed that the ICC was 'colluding' with the Government of the Philippines, which was paying for 'fake witnesses' in the case against her father,"" the prosecutor added.

The prosecution also highlighted Duterte's intention to return to his hometown Davao, ""the same city where he reportedly pledged to 'double' the killings the 'moment [he] return[s]' if elected Mayor.""

Duterte won mayor of Davao City in the May 2025 elections.

""These examples demonstrate a pattern of the Duterte family refusing to accept the legitimacy of the legal proceedings against Mr Duterte and should militate against granting his interim release,"" the document stated.

It also said that Duterte's release would ""provide him with greater access to his associates and family who are actively attempting to interfere with the proceedings against him, including through [REDACTED].""

""The [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and Mr Duterte’s [REDACTED], place [REDACTED] at serious risk,"" it added.

The Prosecution said it would also ""strongly oppose any application for Mr Duterte to attend the confirmation hearing remotely and notes with concern the Defence’s contradictory submissions that Mr Duterte could waive his right to appear at the confirmation hearing while simultaneously claiming that he is not competent to stand trial.""

""None of the Defence’s submissions that Mr Duterte’s fitness nullifies the potential risks enumerated under article 58(1)(b) of the Statute are supported by the Defence Reports. Counsel for the Defence states that Mr Duterte’s [REDACTED]. Counsel further states that Mr Duterte’s [REDACTED] mean that he does not “[REDACTED] necessary to formulate and execute the continued commission of crimes”. None of these conclusions are findings of the Defence Reports. They are extrapolations by Counsel who do not possess the expertise to make such conclusions,"" the prosecution added.

Facing charges of crimes against humanity in connection with the killings under his war on drugs when he was mayor of Davao City and when he was president, Duterte was originally set to appear in a hearing set on September 23.

But the ICC, on September 8, postponed the commencement of the confirmation hearing following a request from the defense team for an indefinite adjournment of the proceedings alleging that Duterte was not fit to stand trial.—LDF, GMA Integrated News"
